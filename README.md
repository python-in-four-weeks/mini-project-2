# Mini-Project 2: Lion King Reenactment

## Setup

As usual, run `poetry install` to get set up with all the dependencies, including a package called PyGame.

## Running the program

To run your program, use `poetry run python lion_king.py` or `poetry run python3 lion_king.py` as appropriate.

## Task

Inside the `animals.py` file, set up classes for each of the characters in the `images` folder, using the `Simba` class as an example.

Inside the `lion_king.py` file, use your classes to orchestrate a reenactment of some portion of The Lion King, or even come up with your own storyline.

50 marks are available for clean code, and 50 for creativity.
